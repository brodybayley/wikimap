Andy's Notes:
User Scenarios

A user scenario is a syntactic alternative to user stories
They have the form: Given _____, when ______, then ______.
eg. Given that I am logged in, when I click favourite on a post, then it is added to my favourites.
You can also chain on an and to user stories/scenarios
